                Hey Dreamers,<br>
                <br>
               Guess what?<br>
               <br>
               You: You started a YouTube channel?<br>
                <br>
               How the f**k did you guess that?<br>
               <br>
               You: It's in the email subject<br>
                <br>
               Oh…<br>
                <br>
               But yeah I finally decided to have a crack at making some videos on my very own YouTube channel.<br>
                <br>
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVuSDxmECCI3xxbkdJkoJ_A" target="_blank">Check out my YouTube channel here.</a><br>
                <br>
               I will be talking about similar things to what I write about here so if writing is more of your jam stick around but if you prefer to see my pretty face and listen to my lovely voice then you should go subscribe on YouTube.<br>
                <br>
               I'm having a lot of fun doing the videos right now but it is early days so if it is something you like me to do more of make sure you give me that feedback (subscribe, like, comment…all the fun stuff).<br>
                <br>
               One of the benefits I'm noticing about doing videos is that it helps me solidify my thoughts.<br>
                <br>
               I'm the kind of guy who likes to talk things through. I'll often start spouting ideas that are only half-formed but just the process of trying to convert the craziness inside my head to something useful means I have to figure out myself first.<br>
                <br>
               This will have a noticeable effect on my writing and products for Dream Career Project so even if you're not the video-watching kind of person you'll stick get the benefits.<br>
                <br>
               So far I've put up 3 videos:
               <ul>
                 <li ><a href="https://youtu.be/sMCDghVaQtQ" target="_blank">If I'm Here YouTube Must Be dead </a>- this is my terrible intro video. It's bad but I had to put something up as a starting point.</li>
                 <li><a href="https://youtu.be/QNIWVcWUVGc" target="_blank">How to get away with being late to an interview</a> - my first content video. I was actually going to write an email about this but couldn't figure out a way to keep it succinct but still paint the right picture so I did a video instead.</li>
                 <li><a href="https://youtu.be/kLOWWe0CWYM" target="_blank">Are degrees worthless? </a>- I've written about this before but this time I went in to more detail about the usefulness of degrees.</li>
               </ul>
                <br>
               Please check them out and let me know what you think. I've also got a few recorded and ready to launch so make sure you've subscribed. Some examples of the upcoming videos:<br>
                
               <ul>
                 <li>Don't take dating advice from a recruiter</li>
                 <li>What is your current salary?</li>
                 <li>The Why and How of Practicing interviews</li>
               </ul>
               <br>
               Ok that's enough of me shilling my YouTube channel.<br>
               <br>
               I'm going away on holidays next week to have some good family fun times at the beach but I do plan on using some my leisure time to work on Dream Career Project (videos, emails, products) so if you want me to tackle anything specific please let me know.<br>
                <br>
               Cheers<br>
