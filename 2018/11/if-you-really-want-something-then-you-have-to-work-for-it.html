                Welcome to Story Time with Zac. Today's story is 'Nothing is just given to you because you WANT it. You have to EARN it.'<br>
 <br>
A while back I received an email from someone I'd never met before. They had been reading my blog/emails and decided to reach out to ask me for advice.<br>
 <br>
They wanted to know how to get a job at a specific company they wanted to work at.<br>
 <br>
This is pretty common. Many people will be looking not just for a job but for a certain type of job at a certain type of company. Lawyers might want to work at one of the big law firms, some accountants aim for 'the big 4' consultancies, and many tech people dream to work for the GAFA crew (Google, Amazon, Facebook, or Apple).<br>
 <br>
I responded to the email and the rest of the conversation went something like this:<br>
 <br>
Me:  <em>"What have you tried so far?"</em><br>
 <br>
Them: <em>"Nothing"</em><br>
 <br>
Me: <em>"What research have you done?"</em><br>
 <br>
Them: <em>"Not much yet."</em><br>
 <br>
Me: <em>"Where do they advertise their jobs?"</em><br>
 <br>
Them: <em>"I don't know."</em><br>
 <br>
Me: <em>"What options for contacting them do they have?"</em><br>
 <br>
Them: …<br>
 <br>
Me:<br>
<img data-file-id="224783" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4a59a29c399bfcd17d39d1d24/images/5f287f89-f4dd-437e-ab6f-48855fd63c74.png" style="border: 0px;width: 545px;height: 410px;margin: 0px;outline: none;text-decoration: none;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;" width="545" height="410"><br>
 <br>
It took me 30 seconds to find out that that company has a dedicated careers page, many social media accounts, AND an online contact form specifically for careers. This was not hard.<br>
 <br>
I sent the links to this person but I fully expect they WILL NOT get a job there.<br>
 <br>
Why? Because they do not have the right attitude, ability to think for themselves, or create solutions<br>
 <br>
If this person applies (and that's a BIG IF) it will go like this:
<ol>
	<li>Standard Cover Letter</li>
	<li>Standard CV</li>
	<li>Standard rejection.</li>
</ol>
 <br>
If you want a job at a specific company then  you need to stop being a lazy so-and-so and actually get off your arse to make an effort.<br>
 <br>
You need to build a wonderful application that tells a fantastic story about you and why this company (which is probably inundated with many similar applications all the time) should consider you. You need to sell them on why you are important to them.<br>
 <br>
It doesn’t matter how much YOU want the job. <u>You have to make THEM want you in the job</u>.<br>
 <br>
Next time you apply for a job don’t focus on how good the job is for you, how much you want it, or how it sounds like a great opportunity for you. Instead frame all your thinking along showing how you are going to help them.<br>
 <br>
Show someone how you will solve their problems and they will want you immediately.<br>
 <br>
Good luck!<br>
 <br>
Cheers<br>
Zac<br></div>
