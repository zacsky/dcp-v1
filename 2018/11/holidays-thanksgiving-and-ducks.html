                Hey Dreamers, I'm back.<br>
 <br>
Did you miss me?<br>
 <br>
If you don't remember In my last email (where I was promoting my new youtube channel - which by the way is going great, thanks for asking) I mentioned that I was going on a short holiday.<br>
 <br>
It was great.<br>
 <br>
I didn't realise it at the time but my holiday also coincided with the American holiday of Thanksgiving. There were a few similarities:<br>
 <br>
Lots of time spent with family, swimming (maybe not so common in the US), eating good food, feeling grateful for all the wonderful things in my life, and just having a bloody good time. And some birds…<br>
 <br>
<img data-file-id="306127" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4a59a29c399bfcd17d39d1d24/images/2f766afb-a163-40ef-bf63-59bed130d267.jpg" style="border: 0px;width: 800px;height: 533px;margin: 0px;outline: none;text-decoration: none;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;" width="800" height="533"><br>
 <br>
These little fellas came waddling confidently up to our room one afternoon in a quest for food…and they were rewarded with the crumbs and forgotten floor droppings from my children's lunch. From then on the ducks made a regular visit to our deck on their hunt for food. Needless to say my kids loved it. I think it was the highlight of my daughter's week.<br>
 <br>
On day 2 (and 3) when the ducks came back but there was no food available it got me thinking about the habits and actions we take without reward.<br>
 <br>
(Yes, I'm really using the holiday ducks as a lead in to an email for you.)<br>
 <br>
The ducks kept coming back, kept doing the same thing, hoping for the same reward. Sound familiar?<br>
 <br>
I see a lot of people who use the same approach in their career. They look for the same jobs, apply with the same generic cover letter, using the same generic CV, give the same (boring) interview answers, and then when they finally manage to land a job they phone in the same middle-of-the-road performance.<br>
 <br>
And then they wonder why they are not happy and why they cannot find a good job.<br>
 <br>
I know because this is exactly how I approached my career for years.<br>
 <br>
But now I know better.<br>
 <br>
And I'm sharing my knowledge with you woth these emails and now on my youtube channel where I am posting videos on these specific topics that can help you out. Namely some good recent ones:<br>
 <br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/XtuQep0_NvQ" target="_blank">Annoying Recruiter Questions: What is your current salary?</a><br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/kFBvUWJw9h8" target="_blank">Dating advice from a recruiter</a><br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/GJfq_feNJUU" target="_blank">How to stand out in your job applications</a><br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/zJJFcdEBqMY" target="_blank">Why you need to be practicing interviews</a><br>
<br>
Don't forget if you like these videos you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVuSDxmECCI3xxbkdJkoJ_A" target="_blank">subscribe directly to my channel HERE</a> and to get alerted when I make new ones (tip: another one is coming tomorrow, and then I have 3+ more in process ;)<br>
<br>
And I promise now to not keep talking to you about my youtube channel.<br>
<br>
I will let you know that I am working hard on something else pretty special - a product I'm aiming to have ready for the new year. I will give you more details as I get closer and also can offer some special deals for you my awesome subscribers.<br>
 <br>
Otherwise, good luck and have fun!<br>
 <br>
