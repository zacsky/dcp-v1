              <div class="mx-auto archive">
                It's that time of year where people start reviewing their year and thinking about the next year.<br>
 <br>
Maybe you realise you let another year go by without making any big changes.<br>
 <br>
Maybe you decide that next year is going to be a big year in your career.<br>
 <br>
Maybe you set some new years resolutions for a new job or a new career.<br>
 <br>
Maybe…maybe…maybe.<br>
 <br>
But probably not.<br>
 <br>
There is one big mistake I see most people making when it comes to their career.<br>
 <br>
Not thinking big enough.<br>
Not planning long-term.<br>
Not dreaming about something huge.<br>
 <br>
Most people rarely think about their career, or when they do it's only 1-2 years ahead, and only at a basic level.<br>
 <br>
A quick thought about getting the next promotion, or moving to the next step, or moving to a new company. Then after that they quickly forget about their career and get back in to drudgery mode.<br>
 <br>
It's no wonder a lot of people are unhappy with their career.<br>
 <br>
I used to be like this.<br>
 <br>
I used to be extremely unhappy, jumping from job to job, focusing only on the next opportunity and then wondering why the new-job shine would wear off and I'd end up unhappy again.<br>
 <br>
For a long time I blamed the jobs.<br>
 <br>
The jobs were shit. The companies were shit. They managers were shit.<br>
 <br>
But really it was my problem.<br>
 <br>
The jobs, companies, and managers were not shit per se. But they were shit FOR ME.<br>
 <br>
These were not the right jobs for me but I didn't know it.<br>
 <br>
I didn't know it because I didn't have any career goals. I didn't have a clue where I was going in the long-term. All I was thinking about was the micro decisions and never about the macro.<br>
 <br>
Now I've turned this around. I have goals, career plans, and ideas about how to achieve everything I want.<br>
 <br>
And I'm much happier.<br>
 <br>
You can be too but you need to start thinking about the bigger picture of your career. Don't just think about the short term, whether that next job is the best thing, or wonder what the next few years will hold for you.<br>
 <br>
Think bigger.<br>
 <br>
Instead of the standard "where do you see yourself in 5 years" think about 50 years.<br>
 <br>
Where do you see yourself in 50 years?<br>
 <br>
For most people this will be retired and well in to the twilight part of your life. So think about what you want to remember about your career as an old man or woman.<br>
 <br>
When you're rolling the lawn bowls down and telling stories with all the other old fogies what interesting things do you want to talk about?<br>
 <br>
What cool stories and life lessons will you tell your grandkids?<br>
 <br>
What career achievements will you be proud of in 50 years?<br>
 <br>
Now write it down and let's get after it.<br>
 <br>
Cheers<br>
