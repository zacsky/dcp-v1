              <div class="mx-auto archive">
                  <p> Last week I was asked to give advice to a family member. They have been having a tough time at work recently and a new job opportunity presented itself at seemingly just the right time.<br>
                    <br>
                    They had been performing fantastically well in their current role (highest possible performance rating and a good bonus) but also felt they were stagnating.<br>
                    <br>
                    They were ready for more responsibility, had demonstrated their capability many times over, but they weren't going to get a chance to step up any time soon.<br>
                    <br>
                    The new role was in the same company but in a completely different team. They were confident they could fulfil the role and had heard the team worked well as a tight cohesive unit.<br>
                    <br>
                    But it was mostly unknown.<br>
                    <br>
                    It <em>might</em> be better but it also might be just as bad (or worse) then their current situation. If it was worse then they would have left a position where they were comfortably one of the top performers and have to ensure all the stress of learning the ropes of a new job.<br>
                    <br>
                    So they asked me for advice.<br>
                    <br>
                    Before I go furether I want you to think what advice you would give.<br>
                    <br>
                    What would you tell them to help them make a decision?<br>
                    <br>
                    What would you do in their situation?<br>
                    <br>
                    I gave them a few pieces of advice that day but apparently one question I asked stood out above the rest.<br>
                    <br>
                    Days later that person told me that this one question is what helped them make a decision.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong><em>Are you running toward something you want or just away from something you don't want?</em></strong><br>
                    <br>
                    It's a pretty simple question but it resonated deeply.<br>
                    <br>
                    When considering a new job or a career change you need to figure out which motivating force is driving you.<br>
                    <br>
                    Are you moving toward something you actually want? Are you moving toward a job or career that brings a positive gain to your life? Are you looking for the next step that propels you further along your career journey?
                    <p><br>
                    Or are you just running away from something you're not enjoying? Are you just so fed up with your current situation that you decided to move on? Did you have a bad day at work, did some angry job search, and stumbled into some interviews?<br>
                    <br>
                    The difference in intent here is huge.<br>
                    <br>
                    Moving toward something is about positive change. It is a conscious decision to move in a direction that is good for you.<br>
                    <br>
                    Moving away from something is negative change. By focusing on what you are running away from you are not paying attention to where you are going. You're essentially moving in a random direction, taking any job that pops up, and probably ending up in a worse position than you started from.<br>
                    <br>
                    Always think about which direction you are moving.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is much better to be moving toward something with positive intent rather than running away from something with negative intent.<br>
                    <br>
                    Guess what that family member did?<br>
                    <br>
                    They didn't even apply for the job. They realised that it wasn't a positive step toward anything special for themselves but merely a sideways career move just to get away from a bad (but not too bad) situation.<br>
                    <br>
                    Over to you now.<br>
                    <br>
                    Where are you in your career?<br>
                    <br>
                    Are you running toward something you want or just away from something you don't want?<br>
                    <br>
                    Have you ever taken a new job you weren't sure of just get away from a crappy job? Did it work out?<br>
                    <br>
                    Send me an email or hit me up on twitter with your stories.<br>
                    <br>
                    Cheers<br>
