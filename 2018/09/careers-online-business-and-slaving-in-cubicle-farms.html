                    <br>
                   "If you're working for the man you're not living your life"<br>
                    <br>
                   "There is only one way to happiness - creating your own business"</em><br>
                    <br>
                   Why is that I always seem these lines trotted out by people selling courses for how to make money online? I wonder what they could possible gain from touting such bullshit…<br>
                    <br>
                   And it is bullshit.<br>
                    <br>
                   Having a career, working in jobs for other people, is a perfectly good approach to life. In fact I'd say it's the best approach for most people.<br>
                    <br>
                   Sure, there can be a lure to running your own business and being your own boss but there are plenty of downsides too.<br>
                    <br>
                   Starting your own business, or "hustling" online as these tryhards love to call it, is not all fairy floss and merry-go-rounds. There are plenty of extra stress-inducing situations that come with being a solo/entrepreneur. I'm not going to go in to all of the possible ways it could fail because that's not the point of this email.<br>
                    <br>
                   The point is to say that it is perfectly fine to not want to start your own business.<br>
                    <br>
                   It is perfectly fine to want to build a career working for other people.<br>
                    <br>
                   This doesn’t mean slaving in a shitty job that you hate, slowly going insane, where your only joy is imaging the slow painful death of your annoying colleague who leaves his toenail clippings on your desk.<br>
                    <br>
                   Lots of people want to make you think the choice is between making money online or working in a “cubicle farm”. Those are just the two ends of the spectrum. There is a whole world of options in between.<br>
                    <br>
                   Do you know why you start to hate a job? Do you know why you feel unhappy when something bad happens at work? Do you know what the real problem is?<br>
                    <br>
                   <strong>The real problem is not knowing what the hell you want to do in your career.</strong><br>
                    <br>
                   Have you even thought about your career? I mean really thought about it?<br>
                    <br>
                   When was the last time you sat down and planned out what you want to achieve in your career?<br>
                    <br>
                   This is the problem. <strong>When you have no idea on where you want to go you have no idea if you are moving in the right direction.</strong><br>
                   <br>
                   Without choosing a direction every move you make it essentially random.<br>
                   <br>
                   Only after you have had a long hard look at yourself will you be able to make good decisions about your career (and your life in general).<br>
                    <br>
                   That is when you can start to make positive changes. Find a new job, learn a new skill, or change your industry all together. Those are hard decisions to make without knowing your long-term career plan first.<br>
                    <br>
                   Do you have a plan for your career?<br>
                   Do you know what you want to be doing in 5, 10, or even 20 years?<br>
                    <br>
                   I'm working on course to teach you how to think about this. A course to teach you how to figure your career out and build a long-term plan. This will be a paid course but I guarantee it will be worth it. A small price compared to the comparative returns of a long, prosperous and enjoyable career.<br>
                    <br>
                   When I finish the course I will open it up to a few people to test early so if you want to be considered for early access hit the button below to register your interest.<br>
                    Cheers<br>
                    Zac<br></p></div>
