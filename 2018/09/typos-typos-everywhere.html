                  <p> You might not have noticed but on my last email there was a typo.<br>
                    <br>
                    The email before that there was also a typo.<br>
                     <br>
                    And there will be typos in my future emails, maybe even in this one right now.<br>
                    <br>

                     <br>
                    But I'm allowed to have typos. These are MY emails. These are FREE emails. I write them to take my knowledge and lessons learned the hard way and break them down so that you can learn them the easy way.<br>
                     <br>
                    I often just write a stream of consciousness. The idea strikes me and I bust out 500-1000 words on a topic and then hit send.<br>
                     <br>
                    I don't review it but I don't need to.<br>
                     <br>
                    In every email I write I aim to give you something valuable for free. If that means you get the odd typo then so be it.<br>
                     <br>
                    But when it comes to your job applications, your CVs, your portfolio, and any form of communication you do with regards to getting a job….<br>
                     <br>
                    <strong>You are not allowed to have typos.</strong><br>
                     <br>
                    Typos will immediately ruin your chances at least 9/10 times. Immediately.<br>
                     <br>
                    A lot of hiring managers will just throw your application in the bin the second they spot a typo.<br>
                     <br>
                    I'll be honest. I hate this. I don't think it is very fair and I also don't think it is a very good method for judging the potential value or impact a person could have a future employee.<br>
                     <br>
                    But us humans are notoriously lazy and when faced with a bunch of applications from similar candidates the hiring manager will look for easy ways to filter out people.<br>
                     <br>
                    They look for anything that can be classified as you not paying enough attention to detail.<br>
                     <br>
                    And when it comes to your career, or a job that is potentially worth thousands of dollars a year to you, I get where they are coming from.<br>
                     <br>
                    If you rush your job application and submit it with glaring mistakes what does that say about the quality of your work?<br>
                     <br>
                    I have a simple rule that helps you avoid submitting job applications with typos or glaring attention-to-detail mistakes. I wrote about this in the free book I sent you when you signed up to Dream Career Project but it is worth repeating.<br>
                     <br>
                    <strong>Write today, submit tomorrow.</strong><br>
                     <br>
                    Do not submit your job application as soon as you write it. Even if you think you reviewed it thoroughly you will still miss mistakes. Our brains are wired to do this for us. Our brains focus on the meaning and the intent of our words rather than parsing each individual letter to ensure it is in the correct position relative to every other letter.<br>
                     <br>
                    This is why it is very hard to catch your own errors. The same applies to programming, journalism, music, writing, and any endeavour that requires us to create output from scratch.<br>
                     <br>
                    Like writing a CV and submitting a job application.<br>
                     <br>
                    When we review these items, we see them as we want to see them or, more specifically, as we intended them to be seen. We don’t see that we doubled up on a single word in a sentence because we focus on the meaning of that sentence.<br>
                     <br>
                    Waiting to review helps break this cycle.<br>
                     <br>
                    Taking time away before reviewing something allows your brain to 'forget' what you intended to write and to review it like a person reading it for the first time would. This is what people mean when they same to come at something with 'fresh eyes'.<br>
                     <br>
                    I cannot stress how important this is for your job applications.<br>
                     <br>
                    If hiring managers are going to make decisions based on such flippant reasons you must ensure you do not give them the chance. Take that extra time after writing your application to move on to something else. Come back tomorrow and review your application properly. Then submit it.<br>
                     <br>
                    No job application is THAT important that it cannot wait one day so that you can be sure not to submit any mistakes.<br>
                     <br>
                    As for me and my typos…I hereby guarantee that I will continue to have typos in my emails.<br>
                     <br>
                    Cheers<br>
                    Zac<br></div>
